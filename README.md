## FIRE - File Repository

Fire is a web application for share files. 


### A brief history...

I am a researcher-student at Signal Processing Research Group in the Federal Institute of Paraiba. 
Also, I am a electrical engieneering student there. In the SPRG Lab we share some files using a FTP local server. 
If you access it from a web browser, it is not a beautiful view, it seems like a poor interface. And we cannot access
it from a external connection, because the network admin not allow the ftp port for external access. 
But, we have access for the pot 80. So, I decided to do a Web File Repository. Thus, we have a nice interface and we
 can access it from outside.
